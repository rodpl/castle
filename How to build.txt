Everything should compile fine using NAnt 0.85 RC1. Anyway, the 
following are some usefull tips if things go wrong for some
reason.


- Where to start the build?

  Use the all.build on the root directory. It compiles everything
  on the right order, copy dependencies and so on. 


- Castle on Rails tests are failing

  Not good. If you have more than one CLR runtime installed, try
  to specify the runtime 1.1

  > nant -t:net-1.1
