Castle was born on Apache Avalon project as an attempt to 
build a very simple inversion of control container. The overall design 
is the result of more than an year in contact with masters 
of the Avalon land like Carsten Ziegeler, Leo Sutic, Leo Simons 
and Berin Loritsch to name a few.

<p>
After several discussions about aspects that an useful container
must solve, Castle first draft was created. Several changes took place until
 its actual.
</p>

<p>
However Castle had more ambitious agenda. Tools like DynamicProxy and the
Management Extensions were used by several projects and a proper home to
support those users and build a community around it was necessary. Along the same
lines, these tools had nothing in common with Avalon's mission, so we had to 
find a more suitable home for them.
