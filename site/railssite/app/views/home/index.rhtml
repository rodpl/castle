Castle is a small collection of tools and a simple inversion of control
container intended to work together to make development of 
applications (enterprise and server like) easier.

<p>
While we don't pursue a paradigm shift, we do aim to 
provide a reference to create application with a nice
design and yet adhere to values of pragmatic programmers 
like orthogonality and reversibility. 
</p>

<p>
To achieve good design, Castle promotes
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Component oriented programming</li>
  <li>Aspect oriented programming</li>
  <li>Separation of concerns</li>
</ul>

<p>
Our sub projects help us delivering this capabilities to 
the CLI. They are totally independent and can be used alone 
as well.

<h3>Castle container</h3>

<p> 
Castle Container is a very simple inversion of control 
container which can combine facilities to grow orthogonally. 
For example, you can add a NHibernate facility - thus allowing your 
data access components can have references to NHibernate sessions - 
 and use our AOP facility which will allow your components to use mixins 
and interceptors. 

These facilities work side-by-side, without interfering  
or depending on each other, to provide you a set of features.
