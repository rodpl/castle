rubyzip is a ruby library for reading and writing zip (pkzip format)
files, with the restriction that only uncompressed and deflated zip
entries are supported. All this library does is handling of the zip
file format. the actual compression/decompression is handled by
zlib. zlib is accessible from ruby thanks to ruby/zlib (see below)

To run the unit tests you need to have rubyunit or test::unit
installed.

= Install

ruby install.rb


= Prerequisites

This library requires ruby/zlib version 0.5.0 or newer. ruby/zlib is
included in most recent ruby distributions.

* zlib http://www.gzip.org/zlib/
* ruby-zlib: http://www.blue.sky.or.jp/atelier/ruby/


= Documentation

The samples/ directory is a good place to start to get a feel for
using the library. For details about the specific behaviour of classes
and methods refer to the test suite. Finally you can generate the rdoc
documentation or visit http://rubyzip.sourceforge.net/doc.
